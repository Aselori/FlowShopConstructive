    "# Constructive and Improvement Heuristics Template\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a template for developing and analyzing both constructive and improvement heuristics for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Students will implement both a constructive phase and a local search improvement phase, analyze their performance, and compare results across multiple instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "1. Implement a constructive heuristic for initial solution generation\n",
    "2. Develop a local search procedure for solution improvement\n",
    "3. Analyze the performance and improvement achieved by the local search using 15 instances from the literature\n",
    "4. Compare results with best-known solutions\n",
    "5. Analyze computational efficiency of both phases\n",

    "**Steps**\n",
    "1. Compute $T_j=\\sum_{i=1}^m p_{ij}$ for all $j\\in J$.\n",
    "2. **Select the first job:** Choose job $j_1$ such that $p_{j_1,1} = \\min_{j\\in J} p_{j,1}$. In case of ties, select the job with the smallest $T_j$. Set $\\pi_1 \\leftarrow j_1$ and remove $j_1$ from $J$.\n",
    "3. **Order remaining jobs:** Let $(j_2,\\ldots,j_n)$ be the order of the remaining jobs such that $T_{j_2}\\le \\cdots \\le T_{j_n}$. In case of ties in $T_j$, order by $p_{j,1}$ (ascending).\n",
    "4. **Apply pendulum pattern:** Initialize two pointers $l\\leftarrow 2$, $r\\leftarrow n$. For $k=2$ to $n$:\n",
    "   - if $k$ is even, set $\\pi_r \\leftarrow j_k$ and $r\\leftarrow r-1$;\n",
    "   - if $k$ is odd, set $\\pi_l \\leftarrow j_k$ and $l\\leftarrow l+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This yields a permutation $\\pi$ where the first position holds the job with minimum first-machine time, and the remaining positions follow a pendulum layout with lighter jobs at the ends and heavier jobs near the center."
