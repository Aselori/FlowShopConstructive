    "3. **Order remaining jobs:** Let $(j_2,\\ldots,j_n)$ be the order of the remaining jobs such that $T_{j_2}\\le \\cdots \\le T_{j_n}$. In case of ties in $T_j$, order by $p_{j,1}$ (ascending).\n",
    "4. **Apply pendulum pattern:** Initialize two pointers $l\\leftarrow 2$, $r\\leftarrow n$. For $k=2$ to $n$:\n",
    "   - if $k$ is even, set $\\pi_r \\leftarrow j_k$ and $r\\leftarrow r-1$;\n",
    "   - if $k$ is odd, set $\\pi_l \\leftarrow j_k$ and $l\\leftarrow l+1$.\n",

    "- Regarding the effectiveness of the heuristic, the results show an average gap of about 23%, with some instances reaching as low as 11.88%. This indicates a moderately consistent performance, though the method still leaves a notable margin from the optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When comparing across instances, no clear trend of deterioration with problem size is observed, which suggests good scalability. Outliers such as instances 3, 7 and 9, however, highlight situations where the heuristic struggles, and including computation times would help balance quality against efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In terms of patterns, results are widely distributed, with gaps ranging from 11.88% to 34.41%, with only a few extreme cases. This points to a stable baseline that could be improved by adding local refinement or multi-start strategies to reduce the worst gaps and bring the average closer to competitive levels.\n"

    "## 9. General Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristic developed in this work was intentionally kept simple and implemented relatively quickly during class. While it provides feasible solutions with an average gap of around 23%, its performance was slightly worse than initially expected. Part of this can be attributed to missing logic that was overlooked during implementation, which limited the quality of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key lesson learned is that even a basic heuristic can provide consistent approximations, but careful design choices and refinement are crucial to avoid systematic weaknesses. The analysis also highlighted the importance of testing across diverse instances, since a few outliers revealed specific scenarios where the method struggles.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future work, there are several straightforward improvements that could be explored, such as adding local search steps, introducing randomized restarts, or refining the construction logic. These additions are expected to reduce the gap significantly and would serve as natural next steps if the goal were to turn this initial prototype into a more competitive approach."
